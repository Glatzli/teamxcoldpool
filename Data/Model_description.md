## ICON

Basically, the ICON grid is a triangular unstructured grid, so ncells is the total number of cells you may find in the
domain. As it is an unstructured grid, you need information on the neighbors of every cell to "re-construct" the grid
when plotting. If what you would like to do is a vertical profile, z_ifc is the variable you need. The model uses and
Arakawa-c grid, so you have mass points in the center of the cell, and complete level points. Some variables are
calculated in the cell's center (qv), and others at the full level (v). Technically, you should interpolate the
variables at the full model level to the mass points, but due to the resolution we used in the boundary layer and the
preliminary study you are doing, I do not think you need to do it. I would use for all variables z_ifc. Regarding
height, I think that for the time being you can ignore the first
point `take [1:90] of z_ifc height to have same coordinates` in the array (the highest level), so you have a 90 level
array (I forgot to storage the z_mc, which is the height for the full level).

The meteogram takes the values in the grid point nearest to the station's coordinate.

You can check what is in the files by "opening" them with xarray. The model storage data every 8 seconds.

`import xarray as xr`
`ds_met = xr.open_dataset("the_file_loc/the_file_name.nc")`

`station_name = np.char.decode(ds_met.station_name.values)
variables = np.char.decode(ds_met.var_name.values)
date = np.char.decode(ds_met.date)`
